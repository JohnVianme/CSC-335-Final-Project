# CSC-335-Final-Project
Yahtzee Team Project for CSC 335
# Overview
This repo provides a GUI implementation of the popular board game Yahtzee.
The software utilizes best Java programming practices to allow for multiple game modes.
Users have the ability to play with friends using the 2-4 player option, or can opt to play single player against a CPU mode of their choice.
CPU modes include a strategy in which the first unused category is selected, as well as another that intuitively selects the most optimal category available from the first roll.
# Getting Started
To play the game, complete the following steps:
- Navigate to and run GUIView.java file.
- When the display appears on your desktop, select your desired game mode.
- Each player will have three opportunities to roll their five dice.
- After each roll, player can choose to hold any number of dice by directly clicking on the dice image.
- Once player has a hand they are happy with or is out of rolls, they select an unfilled category from the dropdown menu and submit the hand. (See categories below)*.
- *PRO TIP* Feel free to check your filled categories and points during your turn at any time by clicking the "Score Card" button in the bottom left-hand corner!
- Once each player (or CPU) has filled their categories, they will be taken to the score page to see the leader board from the game with applied bonus points if any. Players will be displayed in order from most to least points won.
- You will now have the option to play another game. If YES selected, repeat steps.
- Have fun, and good luck!



*Yahtzee categories include:
